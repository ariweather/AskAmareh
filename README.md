My first ever app putting a spin on a classic coding challenge: the Magic 8 Ball. 

<p>This project features my original character answering yes or no questions. She changes her facial expressions depending on the nature of her answer. I built it in Android Studio using Java and XML. The first version is currently in review on Google Play (to get a feel of the app launch and management process).<br>
</p>

<p>As a new developer, I pulled on knowledge from too many sources to count. But I do want to shoutout the sources I was able to keep track of:</p>

<p>Major influences:<br>
<ul>
  -Codecademy's Unquote game through their Building Basic Android Apps with Java course: https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/introduction-to-android-with-java<br>
  -TechCoderA.V.'s Youtube playlist for creating a chat app: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbKub4Jss9oWpmtxAPJ_q9Y_W89D6GeYs</ul></p>

<p>And others:
<ul>
  -Love Coding's Youtube video for removing title from Splash page: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEhsueoatIw <br>
  -Random Code's Youtube video on collecting user input: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eiw5kRObUS0&list=PLlXf_pSEDgb29X8-a9Skj9mZnA1pkta3Y&index=2 <br>
  -And more threads on StackOverflow, Github, and the Android Studio developer guides.</ul></p>

<p>Really thankful for the tons of knowledge available on the internet and the helpful coding community.</p>
