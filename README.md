My first ever app putting a spin on a classic coding challenge: the Magic 8 Ball. 
It features my original character, answering yes or no questions and changing her facial expressions depedning on the nature of her answer.
Coded in Android Studio with Java and XML.
There will likely be more updates as I learn more.

As a new developer, I pulled on knowledge from too many sources to count. But I do want to shoutout the sources I was able to keep track of:

Major influences:
-Codecademy's Unquote game through their Building Basic Android Apps with Java course: https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/introduction-to-android-with-java
-TechCoderA.V.'s Youtube playlist for creating a chat app: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbKub4Jss9oWpmtxAPJ_q9Y_W89D6GeYs

And others:
-Love Coding's Youtube video for removing title from Splash page: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEhsueoatIw
-Random Code's Youtube video on collecting user input: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eiw5kRObUS0&list=PLlXf_pSEDgb29X8-a9Skj9mZnA1pkta3Y&index=2
-And more threads on StackOverflow, Github, and the Android Studio developer guides.

Really thankful for the tons of knowledge available on the internet and the helpful coding community.
